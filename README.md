# Chatbot Deployment with FastAPI and JavaScript LangChain

I have sed a youtube tutorial to get the JS and HTML part

But the tutorial wasusing Flask, which work somewhat slower than FastAPI and FastAPI works well with langchain hence, I had to convert most of th Flask code to FastAPI code. 

THe post method for FastAPI doens't really work. You can check the code for the backend/server side code in the app.py file. Fapp for FastAPI code and app is for the Flask code written from the tutorial.

## Modules and Pre-installation
Do install all the requirements from requirements.txt file if I have made one. Also we need to install Ollama along with Gemma:2b for the LLM to work.

Deploy it by simply 
'''
fastapi run app.py 
'''
